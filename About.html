    Is computer science that hard...
Computer science can be challenging, but the difficulty level can vary depending on various factors. Here are some factors that can
 influence how hard computer science is: Prior Knowledge: If you have prior experience with coding or computer systems, you may find 
 Computer science easier to understand and pick up <br>
 Is CS easier than engineering?
Computer engineering is more difficult than computer science because, in addition to computer science courses, you must also take more
 advanced math courses, additional electrical engineering courses, and a handful of practical laboratory sessions in order to obtain your 
 degree. Is computer science better than engineering?
 If you are more into software than hardware, then computer science may serve you well. On the other hand, if hardware interests you more 
 than software does, then computer engineering may prove to be the better choice.<br>
 Which subject is hard in CS?
I think TOC (Theory of computation (or) Automata theory) is the toughest subject in computer science. Basically, the theory of 
computation is divided into three distinct branches. These are computability theory, automata theory, and complexity theory.
They are mostly extremely satisfied with their jobs and also enjoy good job satisfaction in most settings. The thing is that challenges associated with the design of new software products 
are at the top of why most engineers love what they do mostly. Looking up design solutions is yet another reason why they are happy.
CS is more challenging than Math in one particular form: Math is more of a classical discipline, where CS is more of a lifestyle.
What is the difference between computer science and computer technology?
Generally, computer science refers to designing and building computers and computer programs. Information technology, on the other hand, refers to maintaining and troubleshooting 
those computers and their networks, systems, and databases to ensure they run smoothly.

    There is no such thing as “better” because they lead to different careers and have different specialisations or subfields. Either 
    discipline is a great choice for your studies, as long as you're passionate about technology, and you understand what each study 
    option implies
