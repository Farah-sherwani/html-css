            At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-
            solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in 
            conjunction with artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,
             especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition 
             and machine vision.<br> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of
              advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make 
              recommendations, and more.According to the current system of classification, there are four primary AI types: reactive,
               limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware.What is the purpose of artificial intelligence?
               Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform 
               human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on
                deep learning and natural language processing.<br>
                Artificial Intelligence makes our lives more efficient every day AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things 
            such as connecting with friends, using an email program, or using a ride-share service.The earliest successful AI program was written 
            in 1951 by Christopher Strachey, later director of the Programming Research Group at the University of Oxford. Strachey's checkers 
            (draughts) program ran on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester, England.December 1955 Herbert Simon and Allen
             Newell develop the Logic Theorist, the first artificial intelligence program, which eventually would prove 38 of the first 52 
             theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other 
    technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.Internet of Things Introduction.
    Mobile/Cellular IoT Connectivity, Wi-Fi IoT Connectivity, Bootstrap IoT Connectivity for OEM, IoT Connectivity Management. and
    Use Cases IoT.The internet of things is a technology that allows us to add a device to an inert object (for example: vehicles, plant 
    electronic systems, roofs, lighting, etc.) that can measure environmental parameters, generate associated data and transmit them 
    through a communications network.<br>
    The hardware utilized in IoT systems includes devices for a remote dashboard, devices for control, servers, a routing or bridge 
    device, and sensors.Because of its cloud-primarily based architecture, IoT is inherently extra scalable than AI. The cloud base 
    totally structures and eliminates the want for extra difficult-stressed connections.
